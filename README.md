# Mandatory list:<br>
- [x] Show a prompt when waiting for a new command<br>
- [ ] Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or by using relative or absolute path) like in bash<br>
- [ ] echo with option ’-n’<br>
- [ ] cd with only a relative or absolute path<br>
- [ ] pwd without any options<br>
- [ ] export without any options<br>
- [ ] unset without any options<br>
- [ ] env without any options and any arguments ◦ exit without any options<br>
- [ ] ; in the command should separate commands like in bash<br>
- [ ] ’ and " should work like in bash except for multiline commands<br>
- [ ] Redirections < > “>>” should work like in bash except for file descriptor aggregation<br>
- [ ] Pipes | should work like in bash<br>
- [ ] Environment variables ($ followed by characters) should work like in bash • $? should work like in bash<br>
- [ ] ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ should have the same result as in bash<br>
# Bonus Part:<br>
- [ ] If the Mandatory part is not perfect don’t even think about bonuses • You don’t need to do all the bonuses<br>
- [ ] Redirection “<<” like in bash<br>
- [ ] History and line editing with Termcaps (man tgetent for examples)<br>
- [ ] Edit the line where the cursor is located.<br>
- [ ] Move the cursor left and right to be able to edit the line at a specific loca- tion. Obviously new characters have to be inserted between the existing ones similarly to a classic shell.<br>
- [ ] Use up and down arrows to navigate through the command history which we will then be able to edit if we feel like it (the line, not the history).<br>
- [ ] Cut, copy, and/or paste all or part of a line using the key sequence you prefer.<br>
- [ ] Move directly by word towards the left or the right using ctrl+LEFT and ctrl+RIGHT.<br>
- [ ] Go directly to the beginning or the end of a line by pressing home and end.<br>
- [ ] Write AND edit a command over a few lines. In that case, we would love that ctrl+UP and ctrl+DOWN allow to go from one line to another in the command while remaining in the same column or otherwise the most appropriate column.<br>
- [ ] &&, || with parenthesis for priorities, like in bash • wilcard * like in bash<br>
